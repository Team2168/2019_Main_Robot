# Tested 1/30/2018 and functional?? (Work in Progress, need to upgrade to python). (Versions of code must be as outlined)

To run the UI:

Note: Even if on 64bit computer we will run 32-bit node and packages

- Install Node.js x86 version 0.8.2 (from nodejs.org previous releases section, select the MSI version from https://nodejs.org/download/release/v0.8.2/)
- Install Visual Studio VC 2010 x86 (Visual Studio Express with C++) from Microsoft [link](https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?q=visual%20studio%202010&wt.mc_id=o~msft~vscom~older-downloads) Requires free MS dev account
- Open File Explorer and confirm you have the following MS build path (C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\V110), If not you should have something simular or Visual Studio Express with C++ Did not install properly
- In CMD type 'set VCTargetsPath=C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\V110' 
- In CMD type 'set GYP_MSVS_VERSION=2010'
- In CMD Set the NPM certs with `npm config set ca=""`
- Install socket.io (open cmd and type `npm install socket.io@0.9.11` without quotes)
- Install mime (open cmd and type `npm install mime@^1` without quotes
- Install express (open cmd and type `npm install express@2.5.1` without quotes)
- Install carrier (open cmd and type `npm install carrier@0.1.8` without quotes)
- Run the server:
  - navigate to the PID Tuner folder in the CMD terminal
  - type 'node TCPClient 1180 8090' without quotes. Where the first paramter is the port the robot is listening on using TCPsocketSender class, and the second argument is the webserver port.
- Navigate to localhost:8090 in your browser



Note: As of 12/11/12 Express 3 and socket.io don't play nice together.
